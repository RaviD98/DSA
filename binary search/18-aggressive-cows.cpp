Problem: Aggressive Cows
Link: https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/
âœ… Approach: Binary Search on Answer
- We need to place "cows" in stalls such that the minimum distance
  between any two cows is maximized.
- Sort the stall positions first.
- Search space: [1, max(stall) - min(stall)]
- Use binary search on distance "mid":
    Check if we can place all cows such that each cow is at least "mid" apart.

Time Complexity: O(n log(max(stalls)))
  - O(n) to check feasibility for a given distance
  - O(log(max(stalls))) binary search steps

Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only constant extra variables used
